# TWatch_framework_0

Code from https://www.instructables.com/Lilygo-T-Watch-2020-Arduino-Framework/, by Dan Geiger. Dan uses Lewis Hee's https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/TTGO_TWatch_Library to create a watch with a plain digital face not reliant on RTOS and heavy C++ coding.

Has example apps and simple text menu rather than 'swipe' interface.

**Usage:**
- 	touch top item to scroll it down to centre position. 
- 	touch middle item to select it
- 	touch lower item to scroll it up to centre position

- Menu:
- 	Clock:  the clockface
- 	Jupiter:  view of jupiter's moons
- 	Accel:  display a dot to show Acceleration sensor operation
- 	Battery:  Battery Status
- 	Touch:  Display x and y values
- 	Time: basic time setting (NB I found my watch lost 15 minutes overnight)

- Other functions not fully implemented:
- 	Motor:
- 	Temp;
- 	Bitcoin:
- 	Int time:
- 	Exper:
