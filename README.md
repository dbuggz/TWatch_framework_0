# TWatch_framework_0

Code from https://www.instructables.com/Lilygo-T-Watch-2020-Arduino-Framework/. Uses Lewis Hee's 'Framework' to create a watch with a plain digital face on not reliant on RTOS and heavy C++ coding.

Has example apps and simple text menu rather than 'swipe' interface.

Usage:
touch top item to scroll it down to centre position. 
touch middle item to select it
touch lower item to scroll it up to centre position

Menu:
Clock:  the clockface
Jupiter:  view of jupiter's moons
Accel:  display a dot to show Acceleration sensor operation
Battery:  Battery Status
Touch:  Display x and y values
Time: basic time setting (NB I found my watch lost 15 minutes overnight)
